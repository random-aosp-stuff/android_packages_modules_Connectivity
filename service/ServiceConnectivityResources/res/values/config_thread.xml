    example, the key and value of each TXT entry MUST be separated with "=". If the value length is
    0, the trailing "=" may be omitted. Additionally, the TXT keys MUST start with "v" and be at
    least 2 characters.

    Note, do not include credentials in any of the TXT entries - they will be advertised on Wi-Fi
    or Ethernet link.
